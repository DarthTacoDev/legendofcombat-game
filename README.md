# legendofcombat-game
Repository for my new game, Legend of Combat, which is a topdown rougelike rpg built in unity. This repository is for source management so I don't mess anything up.

Hopefully this game will become something in the future, and I won't mess anything up (like corrupting everything in my project lol).

Hopefully first game version will be released by thanksgiving or christmas!
